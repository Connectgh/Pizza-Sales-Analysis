# 🍕 Pizza Sales Analysis
This project analyzes a pizza sales dataset to uncover valuable business insights, such as:
- Sales trends by weekday and month
- Best-selling pizzas (by quantity and revenue)
- Customer order size distribution
- Revenue patterns over time

The analysis is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook with clear steps, visualizations, and conclusions.
